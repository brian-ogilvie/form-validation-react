# HTML5 Form Validation (the React version)

Easy form validation using basic HTML5 input attributes. This project was initially build in vanilla JavaScript. This version uses React (with hooks and context) to allow for code reuse. But the tenets are the same. The form validation itself is carried out by the basics built into the browser, no extra JavaScript required.
